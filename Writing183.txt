After graduate from high schools, many young people prefer to join in the job market directly. But many others choose to attend universities before they get to work. Most of them attend universities to get more choices, higher pays and more promoting chances in the increasingly competitive  labor market.

Before they go to the university, students seldom have the chance to major in a specific field of study. After they get the diplomas in the university, they will get more competitive when applying for job that were less likely to them. For example, those who have a computer science diploma can not only be suitable for the job in a high-tech company, but also be qualified for any job for which the computer knowledge is the prerequisite. A diploma owner usually has more potential position to choose, it is also more easy for them to find a job that they need and they are interested in .

Also, they employers are willing to pay more for high quality applicants. For example, many  companies wants those that are proficient in more than one language, thus attracting them with  higher pays. Even if someone without  a
diploma has a higher standard score, the employers believe that those who have diplomas are more valuable. Since bachelor degree is viewed as evidence of a person’s ability in a specific area, those graduates can not only have more job chances than those who lack a diploma, but also could they require a higher pay.

 Finally, besides more job chances and higher pays, the diploma can enable us to
pursue a more promising future. For example, a biology degree can help a student find a job in laboratory after graduation, laying the foundation for scientific research in the future. Also the diploma can apply for a doctor’s academy to be a doctor in the future. Neither of them is possible if you do not have a biology degree.
